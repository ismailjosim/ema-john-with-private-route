Welcome to React Core Concepts!

# File Structure
Inside React Project it has 3 folders:
1) node_modules : all the component and Functional add here by React. We don't need to change or edit here.
2) Public: here we have website icon, index.html file. we will show all our created file through this html file. also we can add html css Library, google font, font Awesome CDN here. In Root div div we will show all of our created component and styles.

3. src(source): This folder is very Important Because we use most of our work here.
here app.css & app.js is the most Important file. In app.js we will add all of our component here and app.js show that file via index.html.

Rest of the file and images we don't use those files in this folder.
